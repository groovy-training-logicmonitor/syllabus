# Groovy Training Syllabus

### Goal: 
The goal of these training sessions is to give the attendees a much better understanding of the Groovy language both in theory and in practice. This training will include a basic overview of the Groovy language and its applications. In addition, it will also cover the basics of the syntax and semantics of the language as it pertains to the basic constructs of any modern programing language. These constructs include conditionals, loops, functions and basic Object Oriented programming. Finally, we’ll cover the specifics of the language such as the built-in frameworks and Groovy’s relationship to Java.

As part of this training we will also use several tools of the trade. We will use the IntelliJ integrated development environment (IDE) to write and run out code. We will also use git and GitHub to manage our code as well as disseminate assignments for the lab components of this training.

My approach to teaching is to give attendees a strong understanding of what they are doing and allow them to put that knowledge into practice. The interaction of these two approaches forms a deep understanding of the material that can be applied to any problem given to the attendees.

## Training Format:
### 14 half hour “lectures” (interactive sessions?):
I’ll introduce basic concepts and show examples. The goal is to give the attendees a strong understanding of the theory behind the concepts.

### 14 one hour “labs” (collaborative sessions?):
I’ll give small assignment, mostly through GitHub. The goal is to give the attendees opportunities to apply the theory that they just learned in order to gain a deeper understanding.

## Course Materials:
* Computer with [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/download.html) installed
* [GitHub](https://github.com/groovy-training-logicmonitor)account
* [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) or other IDE
* [Slack](https://logicmonitor-groovy.slack.com) account
* _Optional:_ The [“Groovy in Action”](https://www.manning.com/books/groovy-in-action-second-edition) book

## Course Outline:
It’s hard to know the exact schedule of what we can cover during the lecture sessions. Therefore, below is a proposed outline for the first 5 sessions. The remainder of items are then a list of subjects that will be covered over the course of this training. At the end is a list of proposed subjects, a subset of which we can probably cover during our time together, that we can decide later which subjects we’d like to talk about.

### Week 1: An Introduction to Groovy and someone that is Groovy
1. Getting to know each other
1. What is Groovy
1. Tools of the Trade

### Week 2: Groovy, a better Java, and other Myths
1. Java vs. Groovy
2. Groovy and Java
3. Scripting vs. Compiled
4. To OOP or not to OOP

###Week 3: Programming Constructs
1. Making Decisions, Good or Bad (If Conditionals)
1. Getting Loopy (For, While and Do/While Loops)

### Week 4: More Programming Constructs
1. Defining the Function of Your Code (Functions)
1. Are Code Blocks Anything Like Road Closures (Code as data)
1. Writing some Classy Code (Classes)

### Week 5: Strings and Regular Expressions
1. String Theory (Java & Groovy Strings)
1. Getting a “Kleene”r Idea of what regular expressions are (Regular Expressions)
1. The limitations of Regular Expressions and other unfortunately named lemmas

### Week 6: Collections
1. Making Sense of the Disarray (Arrays)
1. Going all Lexicographical on Your A## (Dictionaries)
1. About those Honey Do Lists (Lists)
1. Let Me Reiterate My Position (Iterators)

### The Rest
After these topics the training will also cover working with the libraries packaged as part of Groovy such as the Groovy Development Kit (GDK), database programming, XML and JSON, web services and unit testing. Optional modules include concurrency with Groovy and using the builder pattern supplied by Groovy. None of these topics are set in stone and therefore, other topics are also possible. We can make that determination as the training progresses.
